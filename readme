designed basic schema of nosql social network
contains 2 collections
users and posts
users will have login_credentials and role defined
in role if it is super_admin then it will have the array of references to other admins
if role is admin it will refer to particular group of users
if role is editor it will refer to array of posts
if it is user the value in array will be null

so while querying we can provide particular privilages to particular role

in posts schema comments will be recursive that is comment have reply which is again comment
